# RALTS: Resume ALTering System

RALTS is a simple, easy to use web tool that allows for people to modify their resumes for a job. Users can add their
credentials or upload their resume in a json file, then add the job they wish to evaluate.  After processing, RALTS will
automatically choose which projects or experiences to show based on keyword searching

# How does it work?

RALTS relies on keyword matching from a list of STEM-based keywords common to a job posting. To limit cost and expenses, it
does not rely on AI in any means.

The resume is then converted to a latex format that can be copied and pasted into the viewer of choice to be downloaded.
